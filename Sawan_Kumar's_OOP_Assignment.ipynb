        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of \"objects,\" which contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods.\n",
        "     > OOP is used to\n",
        "       • structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of object.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        "     > It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "     > It is a concrete entity that has attributes and behaviors defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Abstraction involves\n",
        "     > simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem,\n",
        "     > working at the appropriate level of complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is\n",
        "     > the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class).\n",
        "     > achieved by using access modifiers to restrict access to certain attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Dunder methods (also called magic methods or special methods) are methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__).\n",
        "     > They are used to perform specific operations or define special behavior for objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (child class or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class or base class).\n",
        "     > Inheritance promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
        "     > In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using access modifiers.\n",
        "     > Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, and protected in some other languages.\n",
        "     > A convention of using a single underscore (_) or double underscore (__) prefix for attributes and methods is used to indicate that they are intended to be internal implementation details and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A constructor is a special method in Python called __init__.\n",
        "     > It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "     > The constructor is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Class methods are bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "     > They take the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Static methods are not bound to the class or the instance of the class.\n",
        "     > They are essentially regular functions that are included within a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "     > They don't have access to the class or instance. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "      > The method in the subclass \"overrides\" the behavior of the method in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The @property decorator is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for a class attribute.\n",
        "     > It allows you to\n",
        "       • access an instance method like an attribute,\n",
        "       • providing a way to implement encapsulation and\n",
        "       • control access to attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows for more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "     > It enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a generic way, without needing to know the specific type of each object.\n",
        "     > This simplifies code maintenance and extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "     > It serves as a blueprint for other classes and defines a common interface.\n",
        "     > Abstract classes often contain abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but have no implementation.\n",
        "     > Subclasses must provide implementations for the abstract methods.\n",
        "   - In Python, abstract classes are created using the abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Advantages of OOP include -\n",
        "     > Modularity: OOP breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects.\n",
        "     > Reusability: Objects can be reused in different parts of the program or in other programs.\n",
        "     > Encapsulation: Data and methods are bundled together, hiding internal implementation details.\n",
        "     > Abstraction: OOP allows you to focus on essential features and ignore unnecessary details.\n",
        "     > Polymorphism: Different objects can respond to the same message in different ways.\n",
        "     > Inheritance: New classes can be created from existing classes, promoting code reuse\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
        "     > It is defined within the class but outside of any instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "     > It is defined within instance methods, typically within the constructor (__init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "     > This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__\" and \"__repr__\" methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The __str__ method is used to provide a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "     > It is called by the str() function and the print() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The __repr__ method is used to provide an unambiguous string representation of an object.\n",
        "     > It is called by the repr() function and is used for debugging and logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The super() function is used to call methods of a parent class from within a subclass.\n",
        "     > It is particularly useful in\n",
        "       • inheritance, especially in multiple inheritance scenarios,\n",
        "       • to ensure that parent class methods are called correctly and\n",
        "       • to avoid issues with method resolution order.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The __del__ method is a destructor method.\n",
        "     > It is called when an object is garbage collected (i.e., when it is no longer needed and the memory it occupies is reclaimed).\n",
        "     > It is used to perform cleanup operations, such as releasing resources.\n",
        "     > it's generally recommended to avoid relying heavily on __del__ due to its unpredictable timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - @staticmethod -\n",
        "     > A static method is not bound to the instance of the class or the class itself.\n",
        "     > It's essentially a regular function that belongs to a class for logical grouping.\n",
        "     > It does not have access to the class or instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - @classmethod:\n",
        "     > A class method is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "     > It receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",
        "     > It can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in Python, in the context of inheritance,\n",
        "     > Allows different classes derived from the same base class to implement the same method in their own way.\n",
        "     > When a method is called on an object, Python determines the correct method to execute based on the object's type.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Method chaining is a technique in which multiple method calls are made on an object in a single statement, where each method call returns the same object.\n",
        "     > This allows for a more concise and readable way to perform a sequence of operations on an object.\n",
